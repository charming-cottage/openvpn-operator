  A subordinate charm that sets up an OpenVPN client

  This charm allows you to set up an OpenVPN client for a machine charm. By default this creates a device called `tun0`. As soon as the charm starts, the VPN is connected.

  In general, it is expected that the VPN configuration will include the line
  `pull-filter ignore redirect-gateway` to prevent the VPN from becoming the default
  gateway from the machine, but this may vary by intended use.
